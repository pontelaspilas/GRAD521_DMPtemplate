Data Management Plan for the research project Creating Allies

Context of the project:

This research project will develop and pilot an intervention to train Latino youth as supportive peers (or allies) to LGBTQ youth. The first part of the project involves adapting the intervention for the 4-H youth outreach program. In part two, we will assess whether the intervention toolkit was effective, reduces social isolation, and/or produces civic responsibility.
