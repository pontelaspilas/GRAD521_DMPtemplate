# Data description
This research project will develop and pilot an intervention to train Latino youth as supportive peers (or allies) to LGBTQ youth. The first part of the project involves adapting the intervention for the 4-H youth outreach program. In part two, we will assess whether the intervention toolkit was effective, reduces social isolation, and/or produces civic responsibility. I will focus on part 1. 
For the adaptation portion. we will have community advisory boards. There will be four community advisory boards 1) LGBT youth 2) 4-H youth 3) Parent of 4-H youth 4) Service providers. Qualitative data will be collected from the focus groups. Questions on understanding citizenship and civic responsibility, intersectional identities and solidarity, navigating social institutions, etc. are included in the focus group guide. The focus group will be audio recorded and notes will be taken by the person not leading the focus group. Each focus group will be about two hours each. Audio recordings will be transcribed for analysis. It will be transcribed by the research assistant (me) or professional transcribing company depending on funding. I plan on using qualitative data analysis management software such as ATLAS.ti. In the end, I will have four transcripts that are about two hours long. Beside the transcripts, I will have my own research notes. Most of the analysis will consist of coding. I am unsure of how large the files will be for Part 1. 

# Roles and responsibilities
 The PI is responsible for developing the data management plan as part of IRB. However, the PI and I should discuss the data management plan that was not included in the IRB. Data collection will be done by myself and the PI. We will use audio recorders to obtain the data. In addition, I will record notes of what was said in the event something happens to the audio recorders. I will be in charge of data quality control in terms of the data collection. I will have to test the audio recorders to ensure they record clearly and the limitations in regard to the distance a participant can be to the audio recorders. The audio recordings will be transcribed and we both will check the quality of the transcriptions. In terms of the transcription, I will be in charge of organizing the data in and assigning attributes to each transcription using qualitative data analysis software to conduct the data analysis. Overall, the PI will oversee the whole data management plan and see if everything is being done as it should. Both of us are responsible for the protection of sensitive and confidential data. He will ensure no one unauthorized has access to the data by making sure everyone who has access signs a data sharing agreement. Due to the fact that we have human subjects research, we aim to protect individuals confidentiality so I will code the data to ensure identifiers are removed. The PI will be responsible for data archiving and preservation per the IRB. 

# Data standards and metadata
There are no metadata standards on the current project Iâ€™m working on.  

What is currently in the field does not fit our needs so I will create unstructured metadata. I will create metadata in two places, a read me file and within the ATLAS.ti program itself which is what I will use for analysis. I will record the metadata throughout the research process including analysis. In the read me file I will include the following for the overall project and for each file:

Project Title: Co-creating a telenovela-based intervention to address social isolation and generate community resilience among LGBTQ youth in the USA
Research Institution: Oregon State University
Project Director: Dr. Jonathan Garcia
Grant: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

Project Description:

Data
Name of file:
Format:
Date:
Creator:
Description/Attributes:
Facilitator:
Facilitator Demographics:

I will have three types of data formats for the focus group data, MP3 files of the audio, transcriptions of the audio recordings in a word file, and pictures of brainstorming activities as JPGs. For the data that are transcriptions, I will only have descriptions of who said what. For example, Facilitator, Co-facilitator, participant 1, participant 2 etc. with exactly what was said. 


Within, ATLAS.ti I will have various opportunities to create or add metadata within the data management software. For example, I will create document groups (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zwKBFxxE9o) based on specific attributes. There are now at least 7 focus groups that we will do with different populations. The document groups will be based on these attributes. These will be data formats such the transcriptions and brainstorm images. Another one would be focus group type, 4-H youth, Portland providers, parents of LGBTQ youth, 4-H parents, LGBTQ youth, and rural providers. In addition, I can provide a description of each file that I import within the description box of the file in the primary document manager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZX3yq7IeJ8 . Later on, I will create codes as I read the transcripts. I will probably start with descriptive codes as to when a specific question was asked and then work on open coding. When developing a code, I will give each code an operational definition. Usually, there are at least 30 plus codes for data I typically work with and have had hundreds of codes depending on the size of the file. One of the metadata aspects that will be created will be codebook. I can export a codebook output with the operational definition, groundedness, creator, modifier, creation date, and modification date (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp5xHei_uyI ). Lastly, the analysis portion includes writing analytic memos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txmhlUzJiiM). Analytic memos are like a research diary in which you reflect on the analytical process and comment new thoughts, questions, ideas for future studies, or explanations of why you did things a certain way or why was something modified. 


# Storage and security
The audio-recordings will be on the recorders and will be locked in a safe in the PIs office. The audio recordings will be uploaded on the PI's work computer that is password protected. In addition, the audio recording will be uploaded to the OSU box that is shared by the research team and created by the PI. This will help ensure data does not disappear after I graduate.  The data will be retained for five years as stated in our IRB. 
Incremental Backups will be done when there are any changes or updates to documents. Any new document or Hermeneutic Unit created or updated will be saved on the computer and on the drive. In addition, full backups on an external hardrive will be done monthly and the hardrive will be placed in the safe. Since, I expect to have seven focus groups I will have at least seven orginal copies of the trasncriptions. I will not automate the process through a program for any updates. I will use current standards to use orginal name and date for the data (year month day). I expect to have over 100 total files including documents such as the focus group guides, research diaries, and updated Hermeneutic Units.
