# Data description
This research project will develop an intervention to train Latino youth as supportive peers (or allies) to LGBTQ youth Strategies to reduce stigma used in Brazil will be adapted to develop an intervention for the 4-H youth outreach program which is part of Oregon State University Extension. The goal of the intervention toolkit that will be developed is to create an effective program that reduces social isolation and/or produces civic responsibility. Recommendations for adaptions will be made by 4-H youth, 4-H parents, LGBTQ youth, and LGBTQ service providers through focus groups. These focus groups will be part of the community advisory board. Information gathered from the community advisory board will be used to develop the intervention. 
Qualitative data will be collected from the focus groups. Questions on understanding citizenship and civic responsibility, intersectional identities and solidarity, navigating social institutions and probing questions will be included in the focus group guide. The focus group will be audio recorded and notes will be taken by a research team member. Each focus group will be co-moderated by two research team members and will be about two hours each. Audio recordings will be transcribed for analysis by a research assistant. ATLAS.ti 8, a qualitative data analysis management software, will be used for data analyses. In the end, there will be at least four focus groups and at least four transcripts that are about two hours long. Transcripts will be analyzed and coded through using a variety of coding techniques such as first cycle and second cycle coding methods. In addition, a demographic paper questionnaire will be given to participants. These attributes will be entered into ATLAS.ti as descriptive data for each focus group. Other metadata collected will include photos, interviewers name, co-facilitator name, focus group interviewer demographics, location, date, duration, contexts, recording equipment, and the codebook. The total data size for this project will be between 5 and 10 GB. 


# Roles and responsibilities
 The PI is responsible for developing the data management plan as part of IRB. However, the PI and I should discuss the data management plan that was not included in the IRB. Data collection will be done by myself and the PI. We will use audio recorders to obtain the data. In addition, I will record notes of what was said in the event something happens to the audio recorders. I will be in charge of data quality control in terms of the data collection. I will have to test the audio recorders to ensure they record clearly and the limitations in regard to the distance a participant can be to the audio recorders. The audio recordings will be transcribed and we both will check the quality of the transcriptions. In terms of the transcription, I will be in charge of organizing the data in and assigning attributes to each transcription using qualitative data analysis software to conduct the data analysis. Overall, the PI will oversee the whole data management plan and see if everything is being done as it should. Both of us are responsible for the protection of sensitive and confidential data. He will ensure no one unauthorized has access to the data by making sure everyone who has access signs a data sharing agreement. Due to the fact that we have human subjects research, we aim to protect individuals confidentiality so I will code the data to ensure identifiers are removed. The PI will be responsible for data archiving and preservation per the IRB. 

# Data standards and metadata
There are no metadata standards on the current project Iâ€™m working on.  

What is currently in the field does not fit our needs so I will create unstructured metadata. I will create metadata in two places, a read me file and within the ATLAS.ti program itself which is what I will use for analysis. I will record the metadata throughout the research process including analysis. In the read me file I will include the following for the overall project and for each file:

Project Title: Co-creating a telenovela-based intervention to address social isolation and generate community resilience among LGBTQ youth in the USA
Research Institution: Oregon State University
Project Director: Dr. Jonathan Garcia
Grant: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

Project Description:

Data
Name of file:
Format:
Date:
Creator:
Description/Attributes:
Facilitator:
Facilitator Demographics:

I will have three types of data formats for the focus group data, MP3 files of the audio, transcriptions of the audio recordings in a word file, and pictures of brainstorming activities as JPGs. For the data that are transcriptions, I will only have descriptions of who said what. For example, Facilitator, Co-facilitator, participant 1, participant 2 etc. with exactly what was said. 


Within, ATLAS.ti I will have various opportunities to create or add metadata within the data management software. For example, I will create document groups (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zwKBFxxE9o) based on specific attributes. There are now at least 7 focus groups that we will do with different populations. The document groups will be based on these attributes. These will be data formats such the transcriptions and brainstorm images. Another one would be focus group type, 4-H youth, Portland providers, parents of LGBTQ youth, 4-H parents, LGBTQ youth, and rural providers. In addition, I can provide a description of each file that I import within the description box of the file in the primary document manager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZX3yq7IeJ8 . Later on, I will create codes as I read the transcripts. I will probably start with descriptive codes as to when a specific question was asked and then work on open coding. When developing a code, I will give each code an operational definition. Usually, there are at least 30 plus codes for data I typically work with and have had hundreds of codes depending on the size of the file. One of the metadata aspects that will be created will be codebook. I can export a codebook output with the operational definition, groundedness, creator, modifier, creation date, and modification date (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp5xHei_uyI ). Lastly, the analysis portion includes writing analytic memos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txmhlUzJiiM). Analytic memos are like a research diary in which you reflect on the analytical process and comment new thoughts, questions, ideas for future studies, or explanations of why you did things a certain way or why was something modified. 


# Storage and security
The audio-recordings will be on the recorders and will be locked in a safe in the PIs office. The audio recordings will be uploaded on the PI's work computer that is password protected. In addition, the audio recording will be uploaded to the OSU box that is shared by the research team and created by the PI. This will help ensure data does not disappear after I graduate.  The data will be retained for five years as stated in our IRB. 
Incremental Backups will be done when there are any changes or updates to documents. Any new document or Hermeneutic Unit created or updated will be saved on the computer and on the drive. In addition, full backups on an external hard drive will be done monthly and the hard drive will be placed in the safe.Since, I expect to have seven focus groups I will have at least seven original copies of the transcriptions. I will not automate the process through a program for any updates. I will use current standards to use original name and date for the data (year month day). I expect to have over 100 total files including documents such as the focus group guides, research diaries, and updated Hermeneutic Units. 


# Access and data sharing
The main factors that limit the availability to share the data include our use of human subjects in our research and the guidelines we set in the IRB proposal. For our focus groups, Audio-recordings will be kept for at least 5 years and may be analyzed and used in potential future research studies about positive youth development by the main principal investigator. The data can only be used again by the main PI. I think the data can be made available to future collaborators as long as the main PI is on that study again. The audio-recordings will probably not be made available to collaborators, instead they will receive trasnscriptions of these documents with any identifying information taken out.

# Archiving and preservation
As mentioned previously. I will have three types of data formats for the focus group data, MP3 files of the audio, transcriptions of the audio recordings in a text file, and pictures of brainstorming activities as JPGs. Audio-recordings will be kept for at least 5 years in the PI's safe and in a cloud format. Transcripts and pictures will be kept for a longer time frame (10 years). Metadata collected will be kept for a similar time frame on a cloud. Everything will be backed up to an external hard drive and a desktop computer.
