# Data description
This research project will develop and pilot an intervention to train Latino youth as supportive peers (or allies) to LGBTQ youth. The first part of the project involves adapting the intervention for the 4-H youth outreach program. In part two, we will assess whether the intervention toolkit was effective, reduces social isolation, and/or produces civic responsibility. I will focus on part 1. 
For the adaptation portion. we will have community advisory boards. There will be four community advisory boards 1) LGBT youth 2) 4-H youth 3) Parent of 4-H youth 4) Service providers. Qualitative data will be collected from the focus groups. Questions on understanding citizenship and civic responsibility, intersectional identities and solidarity, navigating social institutions, etc. are included in the focus group guide. The focus group will be audio recorded and notes will be taken by the person not leading the focus group. Each focus group will be about two hours each. Audio recordings will be transcribed for analysis. It will be transcribed by the research assistant (me) or professional transcribing company depending on funding. I plan on using qualitative data analysis management software such as ATLAS.ti. In the end, I will have four transcripts that are about two hours long. Beside the transcripts, I will have my own research notes. Most of the analysis will consist of coding. I am unsure of how large the files will be for Part 1. 

# Roles and responsibilities
 The PI is responsible for developing the data management plan as part of IRB. However, the PI and I should discuss the data management plan that was not included in the IRB. Data collection will be done by myself and the PI. We will use audio recorders to obtain the data. In addition, I will record notes of what was said in the event something happens to the audio recorders. I will be in charge of data quality control in terms of the data collection. I will have to test the audio recorders to ensure they record clearly and the limitations in regard to the distance a participant can be to the audio recorders. We will pay to get the audio recordings transcribed and will check the quality of the transcriptions. In terms of the transcription, I will be in charge of organizing the data in and assigning attributes to each transcription using qualitative data analysis software to conduct the data analysis. Overall, I guess the PI will be the data manager. He will oversee the whole data management plan and see if everything is being done as it should. Both of us are responsible for the protection of sensitive and confidential data. We need to ensure no one unauthorized has access to the data. The PI will be responsible for data archiving and preservation per the IRB. He will also be responsible with who has access to any of the data.
